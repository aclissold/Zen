Zen
===

**Slow down.**

Technology follows Moore's law, but your stress level doesn't have to.

Zen gives you room to breathe. Simply run `zen` and type to your heart's
content. When you're ready to return to the real world, just hit `ctrl+c`.

Zen will enable you to:

* Put your thoughts into writing
* Take a mental break
* Live off the grid, at least for a short while
* Momentarily achieve a clean slate
* Cognize without interruption
* Write a poem alongside your afternoon tea
* Jot some text down to copy & paste
* Think of even more bullet points for this readme

You're welcome.
